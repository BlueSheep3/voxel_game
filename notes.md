# Debug Features / QOL

- faster freecam flying (being able to change how fast it is)
  - player visible when in freecam
- flying without freecam


# UI

- better main menu
- in game hud
  - selected block
  - currently nothing else to show


# Blocks

- good system for block properties
- top slabs, vertical slabs
- combining slabs


# Performance / Optimization

- culling blocks between chunk borders
- combine adjacent faces with same texture into one quad
- remove unused block texture assets after cloning them into the texture atlas
